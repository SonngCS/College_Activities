Here I will post some of my solutions for activities and exams I take.

# First practical exam -algorithms

This piece of code takes an integer "n" (total population of a city) and another integer "m" (total of months with covid vaccination)

The objective of the program is to gather the data of the first and second doses of covid vaccine taken (m lines for first doses, each line representing one month, and m more lines for second doses). Then, as an answer we must receive two percentages based on the total population: one representing the people who took the first dose and another for the people who received the second. Afterward, the program must say which months had the most vaccinated people (one line for first dose and another for second). 

The program was written in a language (Pseudo code) called "Portugol". The IDE used was "Visualg".

# Group Activity -Algorithms and Computer programming

This program has the objective to read a cvs file which has data from brazil's measles vaccination on recent years. From this file, the piece of code has to give some informations and generate some outputs, depending on the user's choice.

# Second Practical exam -Algorithm projects

This problem involves a imaginary telephone company which is trying to spend less when printing the clients' numbers. The logic applied to do that is by omitting repeating numbers (from the first digits of the second number of the list).

Example:
The numbers 535456, 535488, 536566 e 835456 will be placed:


5 3 5 4 5 6

        8 8
        
    6 5 6 6
    
8 3 5 4 5 6

The program, as output, must give us the number of digits that can be omitted.
