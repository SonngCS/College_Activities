Here I will post some of my solutions for activities and exams I take.

# First practical exam -algorithms

This piece of code takes an integer "n" (total population of a city) and another integer "m" (total of months with covid vaccination)

The objective of the program is to gather the data of the first and second doses of covid vaccine taken (m lines for first doses, each line representing one month, and m more lines for second doses). Then, as an answer we must receive two percentages based on the total population: one representing the people who took the first dose and another for the people who received the second. Afterward, the program must say which months had the most vaccinated people (one line for first dose and another for second). 

The program was written in a language (Pseudo code) called "Portugol". The IDE used was "Visualg".
